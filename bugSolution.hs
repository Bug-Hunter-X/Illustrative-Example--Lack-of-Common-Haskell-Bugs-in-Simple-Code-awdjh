```haskell
import Data.List (sort)

main :: IO ()
main = do
  let numbers = [1, 5, 2, 8, 3]
  let sortedNumbers = sort numbers
  print sortedNumbers
```
This code is already correct. The example's purpose is to demonstrate the challenge of illustrating uncommon Haskell errors in simple programs.  More complex examples would be needed to showcase issues like those described in the README (monads, type classes, lazy evaluation).  This simple example does not have a "solution" in the traditional sense; it merely serves as a starting point for discussions on the nature of more complex bugs in Haskell.
