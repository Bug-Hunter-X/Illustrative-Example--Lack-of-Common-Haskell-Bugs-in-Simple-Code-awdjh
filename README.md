# Illustrative Example: Lack of Common Haskell Bugs in Simple Code

This repository contains a simple Haskell program that sorts a list of numbers.  The purpose of this example is to highlight how subtle and uncommon Haskell bugs can be.  Simple examples often do not readily demonstrate the kinds of errors that commonly occur in larger, more complex Haskell projects.

The primary challenge in finding unusual bugs is that the code itself is straightforward and doesn't inherently showcase the issues that can arise from monadic operations, type class ambiguities, or the nuances of lazy evaluation.

To demonstrate common Haskell issues, one would require more complex code involving: 

* **Monads:**  Improper handling of monadic operations (e.g., `IO`, `Maybe`, `Either`) often leads to runtime exceptions or unexpected behavior.
* **Type Classes:** Type class constraints that aren't properly understood can lead to type errors or unexpected type inferences.
* **Lazy Evaluation:**  Unexpected behavior due to Haskell's lazy evaluation can be difficult to debug and requires careful consideration of evaluation order.
